# ddr-finder-ng

Next-generation Web UI for ddr-finder, made to look and feel like a native app.

On Android devices, it should look and feel like the native [DdrFinder](https://github.com/Andrew67/DdrFinder) app.

On iOS devices, it should look and feel like a native iOS app.

## Live Demo

The official working demo is at https://ddrfinder.andrew67.com/ng/, which connects to the [ddr-finder](https://github.com/Andrew67/ddr-finder) demo API instance.

## UI

- Framework: Onsen UI 2; see https://onsen.io/v2/.
- Map view: Mapbox GL JS; see https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/.

## License

MIT license (see LICENSE); excludes favicon.png, arcade-machine.jpg, apple-touch-icon.png,
and other items that have their own license declarations.

## Developing your own version

- You will need your own Mapbox API key and style URI.
- Modify the default API endpoint value to point to your API deployment.

## Acknowledgments

- iPhone toting friends who can't use the Android app for inspiring me to make this.
